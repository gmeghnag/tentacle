# Changelog

All notable user-visible changes to tentacle are recorded here. The format
follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and versions
follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Internal and test-only
changes are left out; the git history and the task docs under `docs/` have
those.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-27

This release adds Docker and Podman as places to run, and moves the protocol
from 10 to 13. **Upgrade the CLI and every daemon or pod together:** a CLI and
an older pod or daemon refuse each other at connect with a version error.
`tentacle update` fetches the matching pod binaries.

### Added

- **Docker and Podman engines.** `tentacle run` and `attach` take
  `--engine kubernetes|docker|podman`; `engine:` in the config sets the
  default (Kubernetes if unset). Podman's socket is found automatically.
- **Remote Docker over `ssh://`.** `DOCKER_HOST=ssh://user@host` works with no
  local `docker` binary.
- **Workspace mount.** With a local Docker or Podman engine, `run` mounts your
  current folder read-write at the same path; `--no-mount` opts out. A remote
  engine never gets the mount.
- **Hidden secrets in the mount.** `~/.ssh`, tentacle's config and common
  credential files are masked inside the container. Add your own paths in
  `.tentacle/hide`, or set `mount.hide` / `mount.hideExtra` in the config.
- **Risky mounts ask first.** Mounting your home folder or a hidden path asks
  for confirmation (`--confirm-mount` without a terminal); `/`, `/usr`,
  `/usr/local`, `~/.ssh` and tentacle's config are refused. On a
  case-insensitive disk (macOS) a hidden *file* inside the mount refuses the
  run: hide its folder instead.
- **`tentacle ps` and `tentacle rm <name>`.** List the pods and containers you
  kept, and remove one. `attach <name>` finds the engine and location itself.
- **`--keep`.** Choose whether `run` keeps its pod or container (`keep:` in the
  config); a kept one prints its re-attach command.
- **Context.** The model sees how full its context is, and can renew it with
  the `context_reset` tool (asks for approval like other tools). A reset
  re-reads `AGENTS.md` and the skills from disk.
- **Skills hot-reload.** A skill you add or edit is picked up without a
  restart.
- **Send now.** `Ctrl+X Ctrl+S` cancels the running turn (or a `/compact`) and
  sends your queued messages at once.
- **Sessions on `connect`.** A `/sessions` panel to list, switch, resume and
  delete a daemon's sessions; `--resume` works on `connect`.
- **Archived sessions.** A session that ends is archived, not lost; reopen it
  explicitly, or delete it for good.
- **Session titles.** Automatic titles (model-written ones are opt-in) and
  `/rename`.
- **Daemon sessions.** `serve --session-ttl never`, and the TTL of a running
  daemon can be changed.
- **Several clients on one session.** Queued messages show on every attached
  client, and each client renders turns started by another.
- **Syntax colours** in file reads, chosen by file extension.
- **Version mismatch notice** says which side is older and what to do.
- **Sub-agents.** Their progress is shown over the wire, and a permission
  prompt says which call it is for.

### Changed

- **`--keep` defaults to true.** `run` keeps its pod or container; use
  `--keep=false` (or `keep: false`) for the old create-and-delete behaviour.
- **Breaking: protocol 13.** Clients and daemons from 0.1.0 (protocol 10) must
  be upgraded together with the CLI.
- **License:** Apache-2.0 (was MIT).
- Sent messages sit on a full-width background; queued ones look sent, in
  grey, above the thinking line.
- A large tool result shows a short note instead of the model's banner.

### Fixed

- **`tentacle ps`:** no footer, a 3-space column gap, and `--keep true|false`
  is accepted with a space.
- A model rate limit (HTTP 429 or 529) is retried, honouring `retry-after`.
- Two edits to one file at the same time no longer lose an update.
- Images on musl, loader-less or unsupported-architecture bases are detected
  before the transfer, with a clear error.
- Tool rows show the real duration, never a fake `0.0s`.
- Ctrl+O expand is instant on long sessions; a tab no longer breaks diff bars;
  the input cursor follows soft-wrapped text.
- A single version marker in the compiled binary.
- A warning when a sub-agent's `model` or `contextWindow` is ignored.

### Security

- The pod stays untrusted: the laptop decides what is mounted, and model keys
  and credentials never enter the container.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-22

The first public release, 0.1.0. Everything below is new compared with no
release. Items marked *(since 0.1.0-beta.1)* changed after the beta.

### Added

- **Agent and TUI.** A coding agent for the terminal with a rich TUI: line
  editing (word jumps, selection, prompt history), mouse scroll, queued
  follow-up messages while a turn runs, `/compact`, `/retry`, and
  `--resume` (session picker) / `--continue` (newest session of this folder).
  Built-in tools are shown with CamelCase labels (`Bash`, `Edit`, …)
  *(since 0.1.0-beta.1)*.
- **Models.** Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint, or the native Anthropic Messages
  API. A model connection that drops before any output is retried
  automatically *(since 0.1.0-beta.1)*.
- **Where it runs.** Locally (the agent runs on a worker thread, off the
  render thread), in a Kubernetes pod (`tentacle run` creates and deletes a
  pod; `tentacle attach` uses an existing one), or as a remote daemon
  (`tentacle serve` / `tentacle connect`, with `--ca-cert` and
  `--insecure-skip-tls-verify` for a self-signed daemon). In a pod the model
  is reached through the laptop: API keys never leave your machine.
- **Sessions.** Sessions belong to the daemon: a client can detach and
  re-attach, `connect` / `attach` / `run` reconnect and resume after a dropped
  link, and a `serve` daemon persists sessions and reloads them after a
  restart. A permission prompt is a session event that any attached client
  can answer; a turn waiting on it stays suspended until you answer.
- **Configuration.** Named config profiles (`--profile <name>`), per-project
  sessions, and the repository's `AGENTS.md` loaded into the system prompt.
- **Agent Skills.** `SKILL.md` discovery, a `skill` tool the model can call,
  `/skill-name` to activate one yourself, active skills kept across
  `/compact`, and a `/skills` panel *(since 0.1.0-beta.1)*.
- **MCP.** stdio and Streamable HTTP servers, a client that speaks both the
  2026-07-28 and the earlier MCP protocol versions, and an `/mcp` panel with
  each server's reachability and tools *(since 0.1.0-beta.1)*.
- **Hooks** *(since 0.1.0-beta.1)*. Out-of-process commands on `tool_call`
  (allow, deny, ask, or rewrite the input), `tool_result`, `turn_start`
  (add context or stop the turn), `turn_end` (continue the turn, at most 3
  times) and `model_request` (a notification). Project hooks in
  `.agents/hooks.json` run only after you trust them, and are asked again
  when they change; `tentacle hooks trust --list | --revoke <folder>`.
  Hooks get `TENTACLE_PROJECT_DIR`, and package hooks also get
  `TENTACLE_PACKAGE_DIR`.
- **Packages** *(since 0.1.0-beta.1)*. Bundles of skills, agent types, MCP
  servers and hooks: `tentacle package install <path | git-url>[#ref]` (or
  `tentacle install …`), `list`, `update`, `remove`. Install and update print
  every hook and MCP command they will run.
- **One-line install:** `curl -fsSL tentacle.so/install | sh` (`scripts/install.sh`):
  verified download, no sudo, then `tentacle update` for the pod binaries.
- **Developer guide** for hooks and packages: `docs/extensions.md`
  *(since 0.1.0-beta.1)*.

### Changed

- **Protocol 10** *(since 0.1.0-beta.1)*. The wire between client and daemon
  is now forward-compatible: unknown fields are ignored, an update kind a
  client does not know is shown once as "update tentacle" instead of breaking
  the session, and a permission request is never sent to a client that
  cannot answer it. Clients and daemons from 0.1.0-beta.1 (protocol 7) are
  refused at connect with a clear version error: update both sides.
- The launch folder is the working folder; `TENTACLE_CWD` and the config
  `cwd` key were removed (a config that still has `cwd` is an error).

### Security

- Writes are confined to the workspace; shell commands go through a
  permission prompt.
- Secret-looking environment variables are removed from the environment of
  shell commands, hooks and MCP servers.
- Optional secret redaction of tool output (keys, tokens, private keys, URL
  credentials) before it reaches the model or disk: `"tools": { "redactSecrets": true }`.
  Off by default.
- Every background process runs in its own process group and is killed when
  tentacle exits.
- A package symlink that points outside the package is refused at install and
  at load *(since 0.1.0-beta.1)*.

## [0.1.0-beta.1] - 2026-10-21

The first pre-release, for testing.
